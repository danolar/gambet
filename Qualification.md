Build something awesome using Chainlink CCIP and/or CCT Standard! This track purely focuses on implementations that make sense in a multi-chain world and use CCIP and/or CCT standard to enable seamless interoperability.
- The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) provides a single simple interface through which dApps and web3 entrepreneurs can securely meet all their cross-chain needs, including token transfers and arbitrary messaging.
- The Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard offers a streamlined and decentralized approach to enabling token transfers across blockchains using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Traditionally, token developers had a friction-laden and manual process to enable their tokens for cross-chain operations.
Use our CCIP Local to speed up your development on your local Hardhat, Foundry or Remix network, then use our Faucet to easily get testnet funds when you're ready for testnet. Links to both at the bottom in the 'Resources' Section!
Qualification Requirements
- Each project must use Chainlink CCIP and/or CCT Standard in some form to make a state change on a blockchain, otherwise it will not be eligible for the Chainlink core prizes. This means that a front end simply reading from Chainlink Data Feeds doesn't count. Using Chainlink CCIP inside your smart contracts is required, though you are encouraged to utilize Chainlink Data Feeds, Chainlink Data Streams, Chainlink VRF, and Chainlink Proof of Reserve as well.

Build something awesome using Chainlink! Anything that came from the Chainlink Documentation counts - using Price Feeds, Data Streams, PoR, VRF, Automation or Chainlink Functions!
Qualification Requirements
- Each project must use a Chainlink service in some form to make a state change on a blockchain, otherwise it will not be eligible for the Chainlink core prizes. This means that a front end simply reading from Chainlink Data Feeds doesn't count. Using Chainlink inside your smart contracts is required.
- While all project submissions are evaluated holistically, there will be bonus points given to projects that use multiple Chainlink services in a meaningful way.
- Please let us know how you use Chainlink in the project description.
